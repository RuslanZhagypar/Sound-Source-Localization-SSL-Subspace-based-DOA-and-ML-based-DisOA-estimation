# Sound-Source-Localization-SSL-Subspace-based-DOA-and-ML-based-DisOA-estimation
The repository is created to support a Capstone project on the topic of "Study and Implementation of Sound Source Localization Techniques"

It consists of two main parts: 
1) Subspace-based diection-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods which include MUSIC, Root-MUSIC, Time-Frequency (TF) MUSIC, and proposed TF-Root-MUSIC methods. It is possible to replicate the experiments described in the paper using these four m-files.
2) Machine-Learning (ML)-based Distance of arrival (DisOA) estimation methods.
